# Troubleshooting

## The PDF looks different after edits

- Always render both the input and output PDFs to PNGs and compare.
- Common culprits:
- Different `MediaBox/CropBox/TrimBox` settings.
- Missing fonts (fallback fonts can change line breaks).
- Watermark/page-number overlays that don't match per-page sizes.

## Black squares / missing glyphs

- PDF viewers can substitute fonts differently.
- Avoid unusual Unicode punctuation. Use ASCII hyphens (`-`), quotes (`"`), etc.
- If you need full Unicode coverage, use a Unicode font and embed it. LaTeX with `xelatex` is the easiest path.

## `pdftoppm` warnings (syntax errors)

Poppler is strict and may print warnings like "syntax error" but still render correctly. Use the PNG output as the source of truth.

If Poppler fails outright:

```bash
python /home/oai/skills/pdfs/scripts/render_pdf.py input.pdf --engine pdfium
```

## OCR errors / `ocrmypdf` refuses

- If `ocrmypdf` complains about Ghostscript regressions in `--skip-text` or `--redo-ocr` modes, use `--force-ocr` for image-only PDFs:

```bash
python /home/oai/skills/pdfs/scripts/ocr_pdf.py input.pdf -o out.pdf --force
```

- If OCR quality is poor, render the page to a higher DPI image first and re-OCR. This sometimes helps for tiny fonts.

## Table extraction is messy

- Many tables are just positioned text. Expect imperfect extraction.
- Try both `pdfplumber` and, if available, `pymupdf` word boxes.
- For high-stakes tables, consider OCR + table re-detection, manual reconstruction into a spreadsheet, or asking for the original XLSX/DOCX.

## Cropping confusion

- `CropBox` changes the visible region; it does not delete content.
- `pypdf` page boxes use a bottom-left origin.
- `pdfplumber` and `pymupdf` word boxes are typically top-left origin.

## Encryption / permissions

- Some PDFs are encrypted with owner-only permissions.
- `pypdf` can decrypt if you have the password; otherwise you cannot legally/technically remove encryption.
